How do people navigate their social world to ensure that their belonging needs are met?

How do our prior interpersonal experiences influence our new relationships?

How do people balance their needs for closeness, or “communion,” with their (sometimes) competing needs for individuation, or “agency” (and vice versa)?
## Research & Projects
It is well-known that the quantity and quality of our close relationships can have profound consequences for psychological and physical health. In contrast to many other species, human beings possess an extensive repertoire of skills that facilitate social connection (e.g., the ability to understand the emotions and intentions of others, to show compassion and empathy, and to help, care for, share, and cooperate with others). Notwithstanding these endowments, forming and maintaining close relationships is not always easy. At the McGill Lab of Attachment and Prosociality, we are interested in understanding the factors that facilitate (or hinder) our ability to engage in the prosocial, communal behaviours that enable the development of trust and shared experience—without which closeness cannot be maintained over the long haul. Our research is grounded in empirical social psychology but also draws upon methods from neuroscience (e.g., pharmacological challenge, genetics, hormonal assessments) to better understand the biological mechanisms involved.
